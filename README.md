# Dataviz101

###PGDV 5200 Major Studio 1

This course teaches students the fundamentals of data visualization so that they can design solutions for a wide range of contemporary data visualization scenarios. Students will learn the fundamentals of data visualization programming tools necessary to complete their projects in this studio course as well as the communication skills to collaborate with programmers and social scientists in professional contexts. Throughout the course students will look at historic and contemporary design precedents, understand where data comes from, explore data to find meaningful communication themes, and consider the privacy and social responsibility aspects of the work. Additionally, students will explore how to successfully and critically apply their skills of communication design to data visualization and information aesthetics.
